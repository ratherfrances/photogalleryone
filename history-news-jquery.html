					<h2>The History of Sporktown</h2>
					<p>The wonderful town of Sporktown has an unusual history. You’ll never guess how the name came about or how the town developed from its small town roots. Few people know the full story, but we have the scoop for you. And here’s the “real” story.</p>
					<div class="moreText">
						<p>Many people can’t believe there is a town named after a tool that is combination spoon and fork. The truth is the town is named after its founder James T. Spork. He founded the town using the wealth from his invention of the plastic Spork. Few people know it was actually his own last name that inspired the idea of the famous spoon-fork combination!</p>
						<p>The town’s start is based around a small factory. James Spork had a few homes built for workers. Once there were some residents, services such as a general store opened. In the beginning times were tough. Demand for the factory’s product waned and for a while it looked like Sporktown might fail. But finally James’ last name inspired him to make a combination of a fork and a spoon, giving birth to the “Spork.” This invention truly hit it big and factory production increased dramatically. Along with it so did the amount of workers and therefore the town population. Restaurants appeared, and entertainment and the arts started growing as well.</p>
						<p>Today Sporktown is a bustling city and cultural center. While Sporktown has changed, at its heart we have kept true to Mr. Spork’s vision. We must never forget our origin and keep the invitation, warmth and honesty that filled his heart.</p>

					<h2>James T. Spork</h2>
					<p>Many people can’t believe there is a town named after a tool that is combination spoon and fork. The truth is the town is named after its founder James T. Spork. He founded the town using the wealth from his invention of the plastic Spork. </p>
					<div class="moreText">
						<p>Few people know it was actually his own last name that inspired the idea of the famous spoon-fork combination! Would anyone have thought of this wonderful invention without such inspiration? Most people use their utensils not even thinking about them. The world will forever be indebted to James for his out of the box thinking.</p>

					<h2>Sporktown’s Connection To Food</h2>
					<p>In order for James to sell Sporks he had to first introduce consumers to something they had never seen before. Some people resisted at first thinking it was just a gimmick or novelty. To impress people he invited world class chefs so the first thing people ate on a Spork was amazing food.</p>
					<div class="moreText">
						<p>He wanted to give the Spork an elegant high-class image and at first it worked. People came to associate high-class food with Sporks. Of course the image has changed over the years once plastic Sporks made their way into fast food restaurants across the globe. While that’s brought the Spork’s image down to an everyday item, never forget that James was a lover of fine food and the best food always tastes a bit better on a Spork!</p>

					<h2>Hot News: Board Votes to Improve Highways</h2>
					<p>As Sporktown’s native and tourist population has increased, so has traffic. The good news is we are taking steps to deal with it. Before traffic becomes too much of a problem we have a plan to expand and improve Route 7.</p>
					<div class="moreText">
						<p>As part of the new plan, Route 7 will be expanded from a two-way highway to a four-lane highway. This will dramatically speed up North–South travel through that corridor.</p>
						<p>In addition to the road widening, the state finally gave their approval for the extension the town board voted on last year. This plan calls for Route 7 to continue farther North. The project is finally cleared and work has already begun.</p>

					<h2>Hot News: “Town” Name Beats Out “City”</h2>
					<p>Sporktown began as just a simple factory with some housing for its workers. It has blossomed into a beautiful town and now are some even calling it a city. There’s been some debate if it should be renamed Spork City in preparation.</p>
					<div class="moreText">
						<p>In a recent vote the town board and the majority of its residents all voted to keep the name Sporktown. The consensus is that it has a more down home feel, plus it would cost to much to reprint everything and make new signs.</p>

					<h2>Hot News: New Ad Campaign Is Working</h2>
					<p>To stem the tide against the rising popularity of the Spork, the Fork and Spoon Industry recently launched an ad campaign to try to tarnish the Spork’s image.</p>
					<div class="moreText">
						<p>At first we noticed the ad was having an effect and sales were dropping. But Sporks don’t take something like that lying down. We launched our own ad campaign touting our greater versatility and eco-friendly design (one utensil instead of two requires less resources). We’re glad to say the tide has turned and we’re seeing higher sales than ever and the Fork and Spoon Industry has stopped running their ads. Fooled you with the headline didn’t we? You thought their ad campaign was working didn’t you? Not to worry, at the end of the day who doesn’t love a Spork?</p>
